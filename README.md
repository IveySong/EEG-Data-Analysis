# EEG-Data-Analysis

Includes data analysis codes for EEG data using EEGLAB in Matlab. Codes are formed by following the tutorials of SCCN (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB#The_EEGLAB_Tutorial_Outline).

1. Chapter1-Chapter-4:
  Chapter1: How to load data to EEGLAB?
  Chapter2: How to determine channel locations?
  Chapter3: Plotting channel spectra and maps (You can find some .png files formed by me as demonstration)
  Chapter4: Data preprocessing (high-low pass filters, re-referencing data)
